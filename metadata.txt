about= This is  proof of concept plugin for Spell Checking your attribute data. It is necessarily clunky because QGIS does not expose the python bindings to allow the native attribute forms to use this functionality - so this uses basic functions from gotonextfeature3 plugin for navigating through features. It's possible to select an attribute of a layer in edit mode and loop through each feature.  It's possible to use a PAN function or a Zoom function (useful for polygons and lines).
